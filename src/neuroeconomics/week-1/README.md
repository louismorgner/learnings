## Introduction to Neuroscience

### MRI Data Analysis

## Multiple Hypotheses Testing

The _Multiple Comparisons Problem_ occurs when you consider multiple statistical inferences simultaneously on the _same_ sample of data.

### Example

Let's imagine you are testing 20 hypotheses at the same time, each at a [significance level](/statistics/terminology.html#significance-level-%CE%B1) of 5%. The fundamental question is: _What's the probability of observing at least one significant result just by chance?_ In other words: How likely is it that we get a false positive (aka [Type I error](/statistics/terminology.html#type-i-and-type-ii-errors))?

::: tip Familywise Error Rate (FWR)
The probability of committing at least one type 1 error amongst two or more statistical analyses on the same sample of data.
